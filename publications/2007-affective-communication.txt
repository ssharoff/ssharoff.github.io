 In this paper we explore the options writers can use for establishing and
 maintaining the relationship with their audience, including the options
 concerning the choice of terminology, appraisal, subjectivity, rhetorical
 moves. We illustrate the study with examples used in several domains and
 designed for dierent audiences, such as general-purpose and specialised
 automotive articles, software documentation and labels for museum artefacts
 in several styles.
