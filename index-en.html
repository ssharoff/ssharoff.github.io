<h2>My job</h2>
<p>
I am Professor of Language Technology and Digital Humanities at <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cts/" target="_blank">the
Centre for Translation Studies</a> within <a
href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/lcs" target="_blank">the School of Languages, Cultures and Societies</a>, <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of
Leeds</a>. My teaching is centred around computational tools which can assist translation, lexicography and language learning.  
On the research front I am involved in several projects related to
corpus collection and annotation, as well as to technologies for language learning and translation.

<h2>My research interests</h2>
<p>

My research interests are related to three domains: linguistics, computer science and cognitive science.<!-- <a href="linguistics.html">linguistics</a>,  -->
<!-- <a href="philosophy.html">cognitive science</a> and <a href="communication.html">communication  -->
<!-- studies</a>. -->

<p> Probably the most interesting bit in my recent research is
semi-automatic acquisition of representative corpora from the
web, cf. the set of available corpora and the procedure described
at <a href="http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html"
target="_blank">http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html</a>.  The
current set of resources includes multi-million word corpora for
Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and
Spanish.  

<p>Web corpora can be curated in terms of domains
and <a href="webgenres/">genres</a>, and also via
automatic annotation for parts of speech, syntactic relations or named
entities.  The resources for developing statistical models are
relatively modest for many languages, so I research methods for
bootstraping them from related languages, for example,
from <a href="publications/2011-dialog-sharoff-nivre.pdf">Russian</a>
to <a href="publications/2016-HyTra.pdf">Ukrainian</a>.


<p>Another recent development is 
<a href="http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/projects/assist/"
target="_blank">ASSIST</a>, a joint project with Lancaster University,
which is about an automatic procedure for finding translation
equivalent using large comparable corpora (consisting of texts which
are not translations of each other).  See a <a href="https://comparable.limsi.fr/">series of workshops</a> and a
<a href="http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642201271-c1.pdfSGWID=0-0-45-1442068-p174109864">recent book</a> on the topic.

<p> My approach in linguistics rests on the assumption that
language is the resource for exchanging meanings. My interests in
linguistics stretch from contrastive semantics (how to study words
that are used to mean things in different ways in different languages)
to corpus linguistics (how to study real uses of words in their
contexts) to computational linguistics (how to dewsign 
computational models for natural language understanding
and generation). See also the page with my tools for 
<a href="http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html">corpus
collection and processing</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>My approach in cognitive science and artificial interlligence
implies that its topic can be viewed as the
<i>computer</i> realization of some sorts of <i>philosophy</i>.  This
view means the possibility to exchange ideas with classic philosophy
of mind. In particular, some notions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl" target="_blank">Edmund Husserl's
phenomenology</a> can be interpreted in this way, including
<i>intentionality, noema-noesis, horizon</i> and <i>internal time
consciousness</i>. </p>
-->

<p>My interests in <a href="communication.html">communication
studies</a> focus on social practices of communities of language
speakers, which result in creation and maintenance of meanings in the
intersubjective space of people conducting communication.</p>

<p>The most convenient access to the list of my publications is via <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qcnf4QsAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>.

<p>See my formal <a href="cv-formal.pdf">CV</a>, as well as my <a href="lineage.html">academic genealogy</a> (the list through my supervisors can be traced back to Poisson and Gauss).</p>

<h2>PhD projects</h2>
I am happy to consider applications from prospective PhD students in the area of my expertise.  The following general topics are preferable:
<dl>
  <dt><b>Automatic Text Classification for Translation</b></dt>
<dd><p>Setting up a translation project usually involves assessing the amount of time required for translating a text and selecting the most suitable translator. Modern approaches in Language Technology can do wonders with text processing, but it is not clear how helpful they can be in the translation settings. For example, can they help to determine the genre of a text, its difficulty or suitability to translators? Similar text classification tools can be also used for tasks related to learning foreign languages.<br />

</dd>
<dt><b>Language adaptation for improving models of lesser-resourced languages</b></dt>
<dd><p>A translation model needs to be applicable to a large number of languages, while the training resources or linguistic models are often better developed only for some languages. Language adaptation can be designed in a way similar to domain adaptation to improve the models of lesser-resourced languages by taking into account the resources available for closely related languages, e.g., from French to Romanian. This can be applied in a range of training scenarios, such as Part-Of-Speech tagging, text classification, translation quality prediction, etc.<br />

</dd>
<dt><b>Non-parallel resources for translation</b></dt>
<dd><p>Modern Machine Translation is based on "plagiarising" large amounts of existing translations, which usually come from institutions such as the United Nations or the European Parliament. This is not enough for many language directions or for specific domains, such as biomedicine. What are productive methods to mine information about translations from non-parallel texts, such as Wikipedia articles on the same topic or news wire streams in different languages?<br />
