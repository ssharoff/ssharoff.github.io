<h1>Back to China</h1>



<p>This was my second visit to China.  When a love affair acquires matrimonial status, you have few options for discovering new things, but you continue enjoying views you already know, cf. Brodsky: Красавице платье задрав, видишь то, что искал, а не новые дивные виды.  I do not have a wedlock with China and I did discover new wonderful sights of Chinese life.  However, even though Beijing, Kunming and Dali werehundreds of miles away, it was a trip of recognition of something I enjoyed on the last visit.



<p>My collection of photos is subtitled "Notes from a serendipitous traveller".  I'm afraid in this trip I used all my luck for the next few years.  When I started the journey, I didn't know where to stay, how to get from one place to the other, but in the end everything went wonderfully well.  Trains departed exactly when I wanted (even if we arrived at the Shanghai train station 3 minutes before the departure), buses went where I would like them to go.  Hotels found me, not the other way around.  And local Chinese were very tolerant with me, an ignorant "laowai".  



<p>A few words about the route.  On arrival from Australia I stayed two nights in Shanghai, the least Chinese city: some expats manage to live there without ever meeting Chinese.  Nevertheless there is a lot of Chinese life under those glitzy towers.  Have a look at <a href="#longtang">the life in longtangs</a>, the Shanghai version of hutongs.  In Shanghai I met <a href="#olgastas">Olga and Stas</a>, Russian expats, who showed me the night life of Shanghai and brought me to a couple of nice restaurants.  In the two days I had in Shanghai, I was able to visit only few places: Bund (this was easy, I was staying in Manhattan Bund Hotel, next to the famous Peace Hotel), the Jade Buddha Temple, and Yuyuan, as well as the Jazz&amp;Blues Café,  Not much, but I hope to return.



<p>From Shanghai I went to <a href="#hangzhou">Hangzhou</a>, a nice city on the shores of Xihu (Western Lake).  Descriptions of Hangzhou and Xihu in LP and Rough Guide are correct, but both fail to emphasise the tea museum (Zhongguo chaye bowuguan).  It is set amidst tea bushes on a hill close to the lake and contains a very well designed exhibition on the history of tea drinking in China, tea production and secrets of making a good cup of tea.  What is more the exhibition space is air-conditioned, which was another unexpected pleasure: I was travelling in August, at the height of the summer heat, with the average day temperatures around 35-40°C. 



<p>The next stop was <a href="#huangshan">Huangshan</a>.  I was lucky again in finding my way there.  <a href="http://www.huangshan.cn/">The Huangshan tourist office</a> boasts a new highway that links Hangzhou to Huangshan in three and half hours by bus, however, the personnel in the hotel I stayed didn't know about the route.  Indeed there are regular buses going between the two places (just go to the West bus station in Hangzhou and buy a ticket), but this does not mean buses are riding on the highway, as the latter simply doesn't exist.  The bus was following the highway which (at the time I was on the journey) was in the process of being constructed.  The torture of jumping on bumpy access roads was relieved by the pleasure of getting on already functioning sections of the highway.  The disappointment typically came ten minutes later, when the functioning section was over and the bus was leaving the highway to a bumpy road again.  Having said this, those sections that are already functioning are better than any other road I've ever taken in any country in Europe, better than Dutch or Swiss roads (and by far better than roads in Britain or Russia).  



<p>A comfort stop on the highway was surreal: after three hours on torturous roads we stopped at a sanitation palace, complete with air-conditioning, marble floors, self-flushing pristine toilets, signs in English.  There was road a safety propaganda on the walls, addressing the dangers of speeding and driving when tired.  What was very Chinese was the style of the propaganda: it was direct, very direct.  Walls were covered with posters exhibiting large high-quality photos of crashed cars, buses and trucks, dead drivers, passengers and pedestrians, spills of blood, fractured bones protruding from legs, etc.  One particularly striking image was of a smashed head with the skull half-open and the brains clearly visible.  I thought I was robust to visual images, even when they were violent, but these images made me sick.  However, if I was the driver, this propaganda should have worked on me: do not drive when tired, and speeding is not an accident.



<p>Back to positive experiences from the long journey to Huangshan.  On the bus I befriended two families, one from Harbin and another one from Chongqing, who helped a lot in finding my way in Huangshan and made the journey enjoyable.  This time I was travelling alone, so it was important to have the possibility to share your emotions with someone you know (even if you met them just recently and could hardly speak their language). Apart from this they also shared with me local knowledge and helped in many practical tasks, such as finding hotels.



<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan">Huangshan</a> scenery itself is fantastic, the climb is difficult, but rewarding.  However, hotels on the top are a bit overpriced.  I was staying in a comfortable basic room for 920 yuan (GBP65, more than I usually spend on staying in a good hotel in London), and this was the cheapest option available (other hotels I checked were even more expensive).  Also the hotel did not accept credit cards, and obviously I didn't have this amount of cash (my rooms in Shanghai and Hangzhou cost about 350 yuan, and both places accepted cards).  As usual there was a solution.  The attendant suggested me a cash machine nearby, which was in just 40 min of climbing (one way; before reaching the hotel I had been already climbing for 6 hours).   For those on Huangshan who are also short of cash, I managed to find a cash machine a bit closer, next to Beihai Hotel, about 15 min from.



<p>The next leg of my journey was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiuhuashan">Jiuhuashan</a>.  LP and Rough Guide are again correct: there are buses from the Taiping side of Huangshan, however, this involves changing in Qingyang.  After the torturous road from Hangzhou, the local bus service to Qingyang was surprisingly comfortable: a smooth road and modern, air-conditioned bus.  I used my broken Chinese to talk to the conductor and passengers, explained the route of journey and the reasons for going to Jiuhuashan, as a trip to one of the four sacred Buddhist mountains in China.   The latter piece of information was somehow misinterpreted as that I was a pilgrim.  



<p>This interpretation haunted me for the rest of my journey.  The conductor arranged a taxi for me to get to Jiuhuashan (for 30 yuan, not much for a 30 km journey).  The driver stopped on the way by a temple and offered me the opportunity to pray.  He was visibly unhappy with my insistence on going to Jiuhuashan instead.  Once in Jiuhuashan the driver passed me on to a lady, the owner of a B&B (again it was arranged by the bus conductor and the price was again reasonable).  They invited me for lunch, after which the husband of the owner went with me to show ways in the village (I didn't expect it to be that large).  He stopped by a temple close to their house and again asked me if I'd like to go there and pray.  Again I insisted on going to Zhiyuansi, the main monastery in the village.  He brought me to Zhiyuansi and started his prayers, being again displeased that I didn't join him.  Sorry, I'm not a Buddhist, not a pilgrim, I just wanted to visit the place.  Anyway this didn't destoy our relationship with the family.  When I was late from the mountains, they went on searching me on the road.  I was sure I knew my way, but it was a pleasant surprise.



<p>On the way back I happened to miss the bus from the Jiuhuashan bus station to Shanghai.  The guidebooks fail to mention that the main bus station of Jiuhuashan is in the valley.  There is a connecting bus from the mountain (free with a Jiuhuashan entry ticket), but my bus stopped for refuelling and did this for extra 20 min.  Another luck: the B&B owner was escorting me to the bus station.  She made a call, the long-distance bus was stopped on the road, so that I was able to catch it by a local service.  Another example of the tolerance to ignorant laowai's.



<p>However, riding that bus was a tactical mistake.  It takes 8 hours to reach Shanghai by bus, and the road is one of the worst I experienced in China.  The road from Jiuhuashan to Nanjing is probably not much better (actually the Shanghai bus initially rides towards Nanjing), but it is shorter (3 hours), and from there you can take an express train to Shanghai.  Another advantage is the break of an otherwise very long journey.  Anyway I safely arrived back to Shanghai, experienced the hospitality of Olga and Stas and flew back home on the following day.
